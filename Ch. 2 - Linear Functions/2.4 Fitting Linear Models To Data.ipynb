    "### Finding the Line of Best Fit\n",
    "Using the line of best fit, we can approximate a linear function for a scatter plot. We first draw a line through the scatter plot that roughly passes through the plotted points. Then, by finding the y-intercept and the slope of that line, we can estimate what the linear function of the graph is.\n",
